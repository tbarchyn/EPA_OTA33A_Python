This program will estimate the emission rate of a gas using a point source gaussian model. It is based on a MATLAB program created by Shahrooz Amin, Mark Modrak and Eben Thoma. This Python version was created to allow more access to the program for those who do not have access to MATLAB.

An example file is included with this program to test the capabilities.
